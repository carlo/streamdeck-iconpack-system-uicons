# Stream Deck icon pack: System UIcons

This is a free icon pack for the [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck),
based on the clear and concise [System UIcons](https://systemuicons.com/) by
[Corey Ginnivan](https://corey.ginnivan.net/). Thanks, Corey!

The pack consists of 420 monochrome icons (PNG, 144×144px). 23 of them come with
red/green alternatives.

## Why

I like clean, "readable" icons, preferrably on a black background. I'm over 40,
maybe there's a relation, what do I know. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
